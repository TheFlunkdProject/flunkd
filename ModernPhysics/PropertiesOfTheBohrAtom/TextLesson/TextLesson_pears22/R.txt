You can use energy level diagrams to see the differences in energies between different states. The energy required to go from the $n=1$ orbit to the $n=2$ orbit is called the "first excitation energy". The energy difference between the $n=1$ state and the $n=3$ state is called the second excitation energy, and so on. When the electron drops to a lower state, it releases this energy in the form of a photon.
