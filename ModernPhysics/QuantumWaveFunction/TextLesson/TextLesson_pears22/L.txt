<BR>Sound waves are longitudinal waves propogating through air. $p=p(x,y,z,t)=p(\vec{r},t)$. They can travel in all directions, so we need $x,y,$ and $z$. For light, the amplitude of the wave function represents electric field strength rather than a longitudinal or transversal displacements. De Broglie had no idea what matter wave amplitudes represented. In 1926, Max Born suggested the matter wave was a wave of probabilities, and that idea is generally accepted today.

<BR>We can learn from the relation between the electromagnetic wave $\epsilon \varepsilon (\vec{r},t)$ and the photon. The energy at $\vec{r}$ is $E($energy in a volume $dV$ at $\vec{r})=\epsilon_0[\varepsilon(\vec{r},t)]^2dV$ where $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of space. Since $E=hf$, $($number of photons in $dV$ at $\vec{r})=\frac{E}{hf}\propto [\varepsilon(\vec{r},t)]^2dV$. But for really small $dV$'s, this might predict a fraction of a proton, which can't happen. So, essentially what we have is $($probable number of photons in $dV$ at $\vec{r})\propto [\varepsilon(\vec{r},t)]^2dV$.

<BR>If this is applied to electrons, as was done by Born, you can write $($probable number of electrons in $dV$ at $\vec{r}\propto [\Psi(\vec{r},t)]^2dV$. $\Psi$ is the capital Greek letter "psi". $\Psi$ is a complex number and can be written as $\Psi=\Psi_{real}+i\Psi_{imaginary}$. Since $\Psi$ is a complex number, $[\Psi(\vec{r},t)]^2$ is actually written as $|\Psi(\vec{r},t)|^2$ where $|\Psi|^2$ means the norm or absolute value of $\Psi$. $|\Psi|=\sqrt{\Psi_{real}^2+\Psi_{imaginary}^2}$ and $|\Psi|^2$ can be written as $\Psi\cdot\Psi^*$, where $\Psi^*$ is the complex conjugate of $\Psi$. $|\Psi|^2$ represents the intensity of the wave function. Note that $\Psi$ is not a vector, just a complex scalar.
