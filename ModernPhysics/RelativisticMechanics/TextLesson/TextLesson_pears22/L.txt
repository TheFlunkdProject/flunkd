Now that we have discovered that classical mechanics is insufficient, we need to use the Lorentz Transformation Equations to explore the concepts of mass, momentum, force, and energy.

Our discoveries must be consistent in all inertial frames, and they must reduce to the classical mechanical equations when $\beta$ approaches zero.
