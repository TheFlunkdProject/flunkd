The time-independent Schr&ouml;dinger equation can be derived from the time-dependent Schr&ouml;dinger equation when the total energy of the whole system is a definite quantity. The wave function in these cases is a standing wave. This derivation requires knowledge of partial differential equations, so we won't get into it.
