In any approach to traditional physics problems, there are many possible reference frames that could be chosen to describe the systems involved. Good choices for reference frames can make a problem easier to solve. <div id="box1Trigger">(Why?)</div><div id="box1">You will generally want to choose reference frames that make as many quantities zero as possible. If you're dealing with events that happen on a moving train, have your reference frame travel with the train so that you don't have to add the velocity of the train to every object on the train individually.</div>
