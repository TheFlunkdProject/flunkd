Louis de Broglie proposed in 1923 that material particles also exhibit particle-wave duality. This phenomenon came to be called "matter waves." Stationary orbits are from standing waves.

<BR>Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger published four papers in 1926 accepting this idea, marking the beginning of quantum mechanics. 
<BR>
<BR>In 1927 interference patters from matter waves were observed, validating de BroglieÂ’s proposal.
