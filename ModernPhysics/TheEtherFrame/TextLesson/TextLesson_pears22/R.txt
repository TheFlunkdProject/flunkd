They decided that if they measured the speed of light in different directions, they should get different results because the earth was probably moving with respect to the ether frame, and would thus favor one direction over another. They performed the experiment, and measured the speed of light to be the same in all measurements. You should look at the details of the Michelson-Morley experiment <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment">here.</a> This, and many subsequent experiments, disproved the existence of the ether frame.<BR><BR>The fact that the speed of light is constant in many reference frames has big consequences. Einstein was the person that took the Michelson-Morley experiment seriously enough to explore its consequences. Here is the formula that gives the relationship between the change in the interference pattern and the speed of the ether: <span id="box1Trigger"><div class="importantExpression">$\Delta N = \frac{2l}{\lambda}\beta^2$</div></span><div id="box1">$\Delta N$ is the number of peaks you see pass by<BR>$l$ is the arm length of the Michelson interferometer<BR>$\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light being used<BR>$\beta$ is the fraction of the speed of light of the ether ($\beta = \frac{v}{c}$)</div>
