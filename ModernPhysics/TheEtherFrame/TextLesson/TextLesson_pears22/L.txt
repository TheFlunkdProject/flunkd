Maxwell's equations are not invariant. That is because the speed of electromagnetic waves (light) is c, no matter what reference frame you are observing in. The classical velocity-addition formula would say that the speed of light should be <span title="v being the speed of the reference frame">c + v,</span> but it isn't; it's just c. So unlike Newton's laws, <span id="box1Trigger">the laws of electromagnetism</span> <div id="box1"><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations">Gauss's law, Faraday's law, etc</a></div> are not invariant.<BR><BR>The physicists in the late 1800's came to the conclusion that light must be traveling through some kind of medium, like the way sound travels through air. They called this the ether frame. They concluded that Newton's laws could be applied to multiple reference frames, but the laws concerning electromagnetism could only be applied to the ether frame. However, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley performed an experiment which showed that this conclusion was incorrect.
