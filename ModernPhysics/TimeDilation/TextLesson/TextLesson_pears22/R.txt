For the person on the ground, light travels farther so more time passes on the train. The time you felt pass was shorter, so to the person on the ground, you look like you are moving in slow motion. <BR><BR>For $v=.6c$, $t_{ground}=1.25t_{train}$. So something that takes 4 seconds to happen for the people on the train actually looks like it takes 5 seconds to happen from the point of view of people on the ground. Keep in mind that $.6c$ is extremely fast, so you have probably never experienced anything like this.<BR><BR>The time interval as measured on the train is called the <i>proper time</i>, and is symbolized by $t_0$.<BR><BR>Since $\frac{v}{c}$ and $\frac{1}{1-(\frac{v}{c})^2}$ show up so much in relativity, we define some symbols to simplify the appearance of the math:<span title="beta">$$\beta=\frac{v}{c}, \, \, 0\leq \beta \leq 1$$</span><span title="gamma">$$\gamma =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}, \, \,1\leq \gamma < \infty$$</span>Extremely important: Get used to these quantities! You will use them a lot in the next dozen or so lessons.<BR><BR>Also remember that the proper time is the <i>shortest measured time interval</i> measured by anybody. The proper time is measured in the same reference frame as the event which is occurring.<BR><BR>The important equation from this lesson is this:<span id="box3Trigger"><div class="importantExpression">$$\Delta t=\gamma \Delta t_0$$</div></span><div id="box3">$\Delta t$ is the length of time as measured in a frame that is moving according to the value of $\gamma$ relative to the frame in which the event is occurring.<BR>$\gamma$ is given by $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$<BR>$c$ is the speed of light<BR>$v$ is the relative speed of the two reference frames<BR>$\Delta t$ is the <i>proper time</i>, or the length of time of the event as measured in the same reference frame as the event</div>
