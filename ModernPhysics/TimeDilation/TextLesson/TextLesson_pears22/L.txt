The first consequence of special relativity that we'll talk about is time dilation. <BR><BR>Pretend you're on a really cool train that can travel at .5$c$. You drop a flashlight, and it turns on as it hits the ground and shines up at your face. Since you are in the same frame as the flashlight, to you the light goes in a straight, vertical line up to your eyes, at speed $c$. The distance it travels is <span id="box1Trigger">$c$ $t_{train}$</span><div id="box1">because $v = \frac{d}{t}$</div>. $t_{train}$ is measured on the train.<BR><BR>According to special relativity, the speed of light is the same in every reference frame. So now imagine somebody in the reference frame of the ground; they see the train, you, and the flashlight all with the speed $.6 c$. Consider the path that the light takes in this person's reference frame. It doesn't just go straight up. It follows a diagonal path:<BR><BR><img class="fm250" src="/imageLibrary/timeDilationTrain.jpg"><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>The distance of the diagonal path is $c$ $t_{ground}$, with $t_{ground}$ being measured from the ground. But the values of the distances are different. We can calculate the hypotenuse in terms of the vertical distance with the Pythagorean theorem. The distance the train moves during the interval is $v$$t_{ground}$ where $v=.6c$, so we get $$(c \, t_{ground})^2=(c\, t_{train})^2 + (v\, t_{ground})^2$$ If we solve for $t_{ground}$, <span id="box2Trigger">we get</span><div id="box2">$$c^2t_{ground}^2-v^2t_{ground}^2=c^2t_{train}^2$$$$t_{ground}^2(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2})=t_{train}^2$$</div> $$t_{ground} = \frac{t_{train}}{\sqrt{1-(\frac{v}{c})^2}}$$The time interval that passes, as measured by you and the person on the ground, is different depending on which frame you are in. This is a direct consequence of the constant value of the speed of light.
