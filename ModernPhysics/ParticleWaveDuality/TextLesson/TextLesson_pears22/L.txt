The Compton effect is accepted by everyone today. Many other experiments establish that light has a particle type nature. But many other experiments imply a wave type nature. The answer is that light is just light: neither just a wave nor just a particle. Both characteristics of light are conveyed by these two equations: $E=hf$ and $p=\frac{h}{\lambda}$.
