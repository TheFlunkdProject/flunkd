In 1897 J. J. Thomson showed that "cathode rays" were just a stream of negative particles that we now know as electrons.

<BR>Description of cathode rays, cathodes, anodes
<BR>
<BR>Cathode rays usually travel in straight lines with momentum. They can also be bent by magnetic fields. In this way they learned that the stream had a negative charge. 
<BR>
<BR>After a bunch of experiments, he said "I can see no escape from the conclusion that they are charges of negative electricity carried by particles of matter."
