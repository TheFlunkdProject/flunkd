When Arthur Compton used X-ray photons to show that photons also followed conservation of momentum and energy principles, the idea that light was quantized finally began to be widely accepted.

<BR>X-rays are between around 1nm and .001 nm. Very energetic.
<BR>
<BR>X-ray tube, how X-rays are produced. It was very quickly put to use in medicine.

<BR>They were pretty sure X-rays were light waves, but since the wavelengths were so short it was hard to prove.
<BR>
<BR>Diffraction gratings would need to have slits spaced .1nm in order to show diffraction patterns for X-rays. So they used crystals instead.
