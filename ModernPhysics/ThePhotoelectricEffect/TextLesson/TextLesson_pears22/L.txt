In 1905, Einstein showed that PlanckÂ’s theory explained the photoelectric effect.
<BR>
<BR>The photoelectric effect is when light shines on metal and causes electrons to be ejected.

<BR>$V_se=K_{max}$ ($V_s $ is the stopping potential and $K_{max}$ is the kinetic energy of the electrons.)
<BR>
<BR>2 important results: Increase in incident light intensity doesnÂ’t increase kinetic energy. 2. After a certain critical frequency, NO electrons are ejected. Classic views of electromagnetic waves cannot explain these results.
