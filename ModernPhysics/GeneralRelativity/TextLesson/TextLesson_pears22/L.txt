Einstein finished general relativity in 1915.
<BR>
<BR>General relativity builds on special relativity because it includes non-inertial frames and gravity.
<BR>
<BR>Inertial forces (take the derivative of the classical velocity addition formula and substitute it into Newton's 2nd law)
<BR>
<BR>The Equivalence Principle says that there is there is no experiment that can distinguish between a uniform gravitational field and uniform acceleration. ($A=-g$) (People usually use some kind of example with elevators to illustrate this.)
<BR>
<BR>General relativity builds on this postulate
<BR>
<BR>General relativity reduces to Newtonian gravitation when mass is as small or smaller than the mass of the sun.
<BR>
<BR>massive objects cause curvatures in the fabric of space, and that is what causes curved orbits
<BR>
<BR>Gravity bends light
<BR>
<BR>shine light in an accelerating reference frame, and you will see that the light appears to curve. By the equivalence principle, gravity does that too. (solar eclipse in 1919)
