Gravitational Redshift
<BR>
<BR>If you were on an accelerating elevator and you shined a light upwards, the frequency of the light that comes out of your laser will be different than the frequency of light that is received on the ceiling, because the frames that sent and received the signal have different velocities, and so you get the Doppler effect. By the equivalence principle, gravity does that too. (experiment at Harvard in 1960)

<BR>General Relativity explained the precession of Mercury's orbit

<BR>Black Holes
<BR>
<BR>Black holes come from stars several times the size of our sun that run out of nuclear fuel and collapse on themselves. Light can't escape their gravitational pull once it gets inside the "Schwarzscild radius." Direct evidence is hard to detect, but there is some circumstantial evidence, including certain X-ray sources that fit predictions of the current model of a black hole swallowing a star.

<BR>Gravitational waves
<BR>
<BR>Similar to how oscillating electrons radiate electromagnetic waves when they oscillate, general relativity predicts that accelerating masses should radiate gravitational waves. There are some experiments under construction to confirm this prediction of general relativity, such as LIGO.
<BR>
<BR>Einstein is a celebrity because of his theory of relativity.
