A free particle is a particle which is not bound nor acted upon by any force. That makes its potential energy constant and we choose it to be zero. So its Schroedinger equation is $\psi''(x)=-\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}\psi(x)$. If we consider the unlikely situation where $E<0$, we could just write the equation as $\psi''(x)=\alpha^2\psi(x)$ where $\alpha=\sqrt{2mE}/\hbar$. The solutions would then have to have the form $\psi(x)=Ae^{\alpha x}+Be^{\alpha x}$. However, one of these expressions will blow up as either $x$ approaches $\infty$ or as $x$ approaches $-\infty$, which doesn't make sense for a particle with no forces acting on it. So we can conclude that $E<0$ does not have any solutions.
