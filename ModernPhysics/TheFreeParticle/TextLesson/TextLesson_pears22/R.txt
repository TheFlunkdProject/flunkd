For $E\geq 0$, we can write $\psi''(x)=k^2\psi(x)$, where $k=\sqrt{2mE}/\hbar$. The solutions here are $\psi(x)=Asin(kx)+Bcos(kx)$. Notice that these do not blow up at infinity, no matter what $k$ is. There are no quantization requirements. The energy of a free particle is not quantized. Using the <a href="http://www.efunda.com/math/trig_functions/definition_complex.cfm" target="_blank">alternate forms of cosine and sine</a>, you can write $\psi(x)=Ce^{ikx}+De^{-ikx}$.So the time dependent Schroedinger equation for a free particle is $\Psi(x,t)=Ce^{i(kx-\omega t)}+De^{-i(kx+\omega t)}$, which is a superposition of a left traveling wave and a right traveling wave.
