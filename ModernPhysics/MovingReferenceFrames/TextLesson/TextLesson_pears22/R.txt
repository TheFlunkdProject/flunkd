Newton's first law states that an object will have constant velocity if no forces act on it. Imagine a sandwich sitting still floating in space with no forces acting on it. It doesn't move. You could also look at the classical velocity-addition formula, and set $\bf{u}'$ and $\bf{v}$ constant and find that $\bf{u}$ is constant.<BR><BR>Newton's second law is <span id="box3Trigger">$\bf{F}$ = $m \bf{a}$.</span><div id="box3">$\bf{F}$ is the sum of all forces acting on an object<BR>$m$ is the mass of the object <BR>$\bf{a}$ is the acceleration of the object</div><BR><BR>We can show this is true by considering <span id="box4Trigger"> $\bf{F}$', $m$', and $\bf{a}$'.</span><div id="box4">These are the measurements of $\bf{F}$, $m$, and $\bf{a}$ in S'.</div> To show that $\bf{F}$ = $\bf{F}$', just answer this question: Would it hurt worse to be punched in the face by <span id="box6Trigger">Jet Lee on a train</span><div id="box6"><img class="normal" src="/imageLibrary/JetLee.jpg"></div> than on the ground?
