The relationships between reference frames that move relative to each other are what Einstein's theory of relativitys help us to understand. <BR><BR>Consider a man dropping a sandwich while riding a train. In the reference frame of the train tracks, the man, the sandwich, and the train all have a constant horizontal velocity, but the sandwich also has a vertical acceleration.  The path it traces according to the train tracks is shown in <span id="box1Trigger">this picture.</span><div id="box1"><img class="normal" src="/imageLibrary/sandwichDrop.jpg">The path the sandwich travels is a parabola.</div> In the reference frame of the train, the sandwich just falls straight down to the man's feet. So in both reference frames, the sandwich ends up in the same place relative to the man. This all assumes that Newton's laws of motion are invariant.<BR><BR>In an analysis of this type of situation we can use the classical velocity-addition formula: <span id="box2Trigger"><div class="importantExpression">$\bf{u} = \bf{u}' + \bf{v}$</div></span><div id="box2">$\bf{u}$ is the velocity of the object in the reference frame S<BR>$\bf{u}'$ is the velocity of the object in the reference frame S'<BR>$\bf{v}$ is the velocity of the reference frame S' with respect to S.</div><BR><BR>Why are Newton's laws invariant? We can go through each law and consider why each of them is invariant.
