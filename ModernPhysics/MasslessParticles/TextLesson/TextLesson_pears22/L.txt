This would seem impossible in classical mechanics, but relativity actually allows it to happen.
<BR>
<BR>Consider $E=\gamma mc^2=\frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{u^2}{c^2}}}$
<BR>
<BR>Even if $m=0$, $E$ doesn't have to be zero. Why not?

<BR>
<BR>Photons travel at $u=c$, and they have no mass. But they have energy and momentum, like other particles.

<BR>$E^2=(pc)^2+(mc^2)^2$
<BR>
<BR>$m=0\Rightarrow E=pc$
