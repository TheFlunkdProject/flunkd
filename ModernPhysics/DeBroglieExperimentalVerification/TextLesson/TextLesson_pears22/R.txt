<BR>Young's double slit experiment has also been performed for electron waves.

<BR>Because electrons have much shorter wavelengths per energy than photons, electron microscopes can resolve objects sa tiny as about $10^{-11}m$ while light microscopes can only resolve objects of around $10^{-6}$.

<BR>Neutron diffraction is also used sometimes.
