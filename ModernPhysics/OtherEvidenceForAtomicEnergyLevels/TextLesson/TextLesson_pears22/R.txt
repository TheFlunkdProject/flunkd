The energies at which the current dropped match with mercury's spectrum.

<BR>Energy levels of atoms are often measured by sending electrons through a gas and using a magnetic field to measure the energies of electrons that get scattered at a certain angle. The number of electrons that lose certain energies are counted and this is an energy-loss spectrum.
