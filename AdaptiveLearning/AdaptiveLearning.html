What is adaptive learning?
<br><br>
Previous to the advent of the internet, a system that implemented adaptive learning 
in any practical way would have been impossible to create. Students have had to 
adapt <i>themselves</i> (to the extent possible) to the way the <i>teacher</i> 
chose to present material. Adaptive learning adjusts the <i>lesson</i> to the 
<i>student</i>.
<br><br>
If each of us had a private tutor that understood our needs and likes, 
we could learn at a much faster pace than we could in a classroom. It's not that we each 
think and learn in such radical ways that it's impossible to track; it's just that when 
you put a few dozen of us together and try to teach us all in the same way, things get 
very difficult for everyone. Difficulty can sometimes be a motivator to try harder, but in 
this case it clouds our minds and smothers our curiosity. Curiosity 
is the most powerful way to motivate the mind. Adaptive learning will eventually clear the 
path for curiosity to work its wonder.

This video captures the basic concept of adaptive learning:

The difference between what Khan Academe is talking about and what the world needs right now is 
that the focus needs to be on the experience of the student - not the result of the lesson. 
Students can feel when they are learning, and they know what they need better than any 
efficiency algorithm. Basing the student's struggle on results is only an attempt to solve 
the problem indirectly. 
<br><br>
The solution will actually be a combination of these two approaches. But this approach will 
need to be the foundation on which the other approach builds. Making a funner learning 
experience for students will attract more students and will spread faster than focusing 
only on results. We aim to create a Pandora-like approach to education. But we 
need help spreading this idea so that more people want to try it. 
<br><br>
Once people begin to see the power behind adaptive learning it will begin 
to be widely adopted, and all kinds of approaches will be experimented with. We will get 
closer and closer to a perfect solution that will have 14 year-olds earning
college degrees.
