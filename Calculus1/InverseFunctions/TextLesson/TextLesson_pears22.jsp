<h3>1.6 - Inverse Functions</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->
The three things in this section are:
<ul><li>How to determine if something is a function
<li>How to determine if a function is one-to-one
<li>How to find inverse functions
</ul>
<br>1. How to determine if something is a function:
<br><br><img src="../../Functions/image73.png" alt="y=f(x)" style="height:14px;" > is a function if <a href="#"   >no value of x has two corresponding y values.<span class="B1">So if you plug in some number for x, there will either be no y value that pops out, or exactly one.</span></a>
Most of the things we deal with in Calculus 1 are functions, because they are useful and easy to work with.
<br><br>If you know what the graph of f(x) looks like, you can apply the vertical line test.
 If you can draw a vertical line anywhere on the graph, and the curve f only crosses it once or never, <a href="#"   >f is a function.<span class="B1"><img src="../../Graphs/graphVertLineTest2.png" class="Floatleft100">The vertical line crosses the function only once, so this is a function.</span></a>
If there is any place where f crosses a vertical line twice, then <a href="#"   >f is not a function.<span class="B1"><img src="../../Graphs/graphVertLineTest1.png" class="Floatleft100">Circles fail the vertical line test. The line crosses the circle twice, so circles are not functions. <p>Also, the standard form of the eq
uations of a circ
le is x^2+y^2=r
^2. If you solve for y, you can see this happen.</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image75.png"><p>when you take the square root of both sides of an equation, one side gets a <img src="../../Functions/image76.png"> sign. The <img src="../../Functions/image76.png"> is what makes this not a function. Plug in anything but r for x, and you will get 2 answers for y, both a positive value and a negative value. This goes against the definition of a function.</p></span></a>
<br><br>2. How to determine if a function is one-to-one:
<br><br>A function is one-to-one if the same test for a function is applied the other way around: When you plug in a y value, either one or no value comes out for x.

<br><br>If you know the graph of a function, it is often easier to draw the graph and apply the horizontal line test than to solve for x. This is similar to the vertical line test, but instead of drawing a vertical line, you draw a horizontal line across the graph. <a href="#">If it crosses once or never, it is one-to-one.<span class="B1"><img src="../../Graphs/graphHorLineTest1.png" class="Floatleft100"><p>This passes the horizontal line test, so it is one-to-one.</p>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<img src="../../Graphs/graphHorLineTest2.png" class="Floatright100"><p>This fails the horizontal line test because a horizontal line touches the function at two points, so it is not one-to-one.</p></span></a>
<br><br>3. How to find inverse functions:
<br><br>There are three steps to do this. 
<ol><li>Switch all the x's and y's
<li>Solve for the new y. (Get the y by itself on one side of the equation. This is the actual inversion process.)
<li>Sometimes it may be necessary to change the y out for a f-1(x). This signifies that it is the inverse of f(x). f(x) and y are generally the same. 
<br>(Remember, though, that f-1(x) is not the same as having a negative 1 exponent.)
<br>To find what the inverse of a graph looks like, just flip the graph over the line y=x. You can also take each point in the original function and switch the x and y coordinates.
