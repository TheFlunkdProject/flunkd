Let's do an example.
<BR>
<BR>Let's find the <span id="box2Trigger">exact area under the curve $f(x)=3-x^2$ from $x=0$ to $x=2$</span><span id="box2"><img src="../../Graphs/graphareaunder3-x^2.png"></span>. We'll do it by starting with the formula for right endpoint rectangles.$$x_i=0+i\Delta x=\frac{2i}{n}$$ $$A=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n[3-(\frac{2i}{n})^2]\frac{2}{n}$$ $$=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n[\frac{6}{n}-\frac{8i^2}{n^3}]$$ $$=\lim_{n\to\infty}[\frac{6}{n}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n1-\frac{8}{n^3}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}i^2] $$Now that we have these summations in the forms we need them to be in, we can use the formulas for this section, which you are probably required to memorize if you're in a class.$$\lim_{n\to\infty}[\frac{6n}{n}-\frac{8}{n^3}\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}]$$$$=\lim_{n\to\infty}[6-\frac{4(n+1)(2n+1)}{3n^2}] $$$$= 6- \frac{4*2}{3}=6-\frac{8}{3}=\frac{10}{3}$$<span id="box3Trigger">If you are finding</span><span id="box3">in Calculus 1 at least</span> the area under a curve, and you get infinity for an answer, you did something wrong. These are all finite areas that we are finding. The limits should all turn into finite numbers.
