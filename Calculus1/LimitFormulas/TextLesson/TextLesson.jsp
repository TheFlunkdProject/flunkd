<h3>4.2 - Limit Formulas</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->


<p>Now we find the exact area under a curve with the same formulas as in the last section, but now with <img src="../../Functions/image620.png" alt="limn"> in front of <a href="#">the area formula
	<span class="B1">You can start with any method and end up finding the same area in the end.</span></a>.</p>

<p>Instead of plugging in the limit first like with normal limits, there is some arranging that we need to do. We need to get every problem into one of <a href="#">these forms
	<span class="B1">Look at the left-hand sides of the equations.</span></a>:</p>

<img src="../../Functions/image621.png" alt="i=1n1=n"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image622.png" alt="i=1ni=n(n+1)2"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image623.png" alt="i=1ni2=n(n+1)(2n+1)6"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image624.png" alt="i=1ni3=(n(n+1)2)2">

<p>We arrive at these forms by setting everything up like usual, and then factoring out all of the numbers and nâ€™s from every term in the summation, using these properties of sums:</p>

<img src="../../Functions/image625.png" alt="i=1naf(x)=ai=1nf(x)">,  <img src="../../Functions/image626.png" alt="i=1n[f(x)+g(x)]=i=1nf(x)+i=1ng(x)">

<p>Let's do an example.</p>

<p>Let's find the <a href="#" class="L1">exact area under the curve <img src="../../Functions/image627.png" alt="f(x)=3-x^2"> from x=0 to x=2
<img src="../../Graphs/graphareaunder3-x^2.png" class="imgA1"></a>
We'll do it by starting with the formula for right endpoint rectangles.</p>

<img src="../../Functions/image628.png" alt="xi=0+ix=2in">
A=ni=1n[3-(2in)2]*2n=ni=1n[6n-8i2n3]=n[6ni=1n1-8n3i=1ni2] 

<p>Now that we have these summations in the forms we need them to be in, we can use the formulas for this section, which you are probably required to memorize.</p>

<img src="../../Functions/image629.png" alt="=n[6nn-8n3n(n+1)(2n+1)6]"><img src="../../Functions/image630.png" alt="=n[6-4(n+1)(2n+1)3n2] = 6- 4*23=6-83=103">

<p><a href="#">If you are finding
	<span class="B1">in Calculus 1 at least</span></a> the area under a curve, and you still get infinity for an answer, you did something wrong. These are all finite areas that we are finding. The limits all turn into finite numbers.</p>
