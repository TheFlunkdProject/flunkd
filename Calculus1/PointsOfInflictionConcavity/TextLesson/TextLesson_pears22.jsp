<h3>3.12 - Points of Inflection, Concavity</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->



<p>If you want to know about the concavity of a function (if it curves up or 
down), or about its points of inflection (where its concavity changes), you 
use the second derivative.</p>

<p>If a function is concave up, it is curving in an upward direction. A 
parabola like y=x^2 is <a href="#">curved upwards
	<span class="B1">The second derivative is the rate of change of the 
rate of change, so it's like the rate of change of the slope. When a slope 
changes, the result is a curved graph.</span></a>, so we say that it is 
"concave up." y=-x^2 is concave down.</p>

<p>There is a little thing called the “second derivative test.” What we were 
using before to find local minima and maxima is called the "first derivative 
test." </p>

<p>You use the second derivative test by finding the critical numbers the 
normal way, and then finding out if the second derivative is positive or 
negative at each of those points. <a href="#">If the second derivative is 
positive, you have a minimum. If it's negative, you have a maximum.
	<span class="B1">One way to remember the negative<img 
src="../../Functions/image523.png" alt="->">maximum, and positive<img src="../../Functions/image523.png" 
alt="->">minimum rule is to use these happy and sad faces:<br><img src="../../Graphs/happysadfaces.png" class="P1"></span></a></p>

<p><a href="#">Example<span class="B1">If you had a curve with a critical 
point at x=2, and you found that its second derivative was <img 
src="../../Functions/image524.png" alt="f''(x)=-x2+1">, then <img src="../../Functions/image525.png" 
alt="f''(2)=-(2)2+1=-3">, and that would tell you that f has a maximum at 
x=2</span></a></p>

<p>Now, to find where a point of inflection is, you do the exact same thing 
you did to find where a minimum or a maximum is, but with the second 
derivative instead of the first.</p>

<img src="../../Functions/image526.png" alt="f''(x)=(x2-1)(4x-3)=0"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image527.png" alt="x=-1,3/4,1">

<p>You plot these on <a href="#" class="L1">a number line<img src="../../Graphs/numberline3.1.png" class="imgA1"></a>, then pick points in 
between. If the second derivative is positive, it's concave up, and if it's 
negative, it's concave down.</p>


<h5>Pick x=-2</h5>
<a href="#" class="L1"><img src="../../Functions/image528.png" alt="f''(-2)=((-2)2-1)(4(-2)-3)=(4-3)(-5)<0"> <img src="../../Graphs/numberline3.2.png" class="imgA1"></a>

<h5>Pick <img src="../../Functions/image529.png" alt="x=0"></h5>
<a href="#" class="L1"><img src="../../Functions/image530.png" alt="f''(0)=(02-1)(4(0)-3)=(-)(-)>0"> <img src="../../Graphs/numberline3.3.png" class="imgA1"></a>

<h5><img src="../../Functions/image531.png" alt="x=3/8"></h5>
<a href="#" class="L1"><img src="../../Functions/image532.png" alt="f''(38)=(382-1)(4(38)-3)=(-)(-)>0"> <img src="../../Graphs/numberline3.4.png" class="imgA1"></a>

<h5><img src="../../Functions/image533.png" alt="x=200,000"></h5>
<a href="#" class="L1"><img src="../../Functions/image534.png" alt="f''(200,000)=(200,0002-1)(4(200,000)-3)=(+)(+)>0"> <img src="../../Graphs/numberline3.5.png" class="imgA1"></a>

<p>So it only changes concavity at x=-1. A point of inflection is wherever 
the second derivative changes signs. So there is a point of inflection at 
x=-1, and it is <img src="../../Functions/image535.png" alt="(-1,f(-1))=(-1,8)"></p>


<p>If they ask you which intervals were concave up and down, your answer 
would look like this:</p>

<p>Concave up: <a href="#"><img src="../../Functions/image536.png" alt="(-1,34)(34,1)
(1,)"><span class="B1">They are all open parentheses because at each end 
point the concavity is neither up or down; the second derivative is just 
zero there.</span></a></p>

<p>Concave down: <img src="../../Functions/image537.png" alt="(-,-1)"></p>

<p>Now you have several tools to find the graph of any function. You have a 
few from algebra, and now you have a couple from calculus. If you want to 
find a detailed graph of any function, this is the process you follow.
