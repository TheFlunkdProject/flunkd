If you want to know about the concavity of a function (if it curves up or down), or about its points of inflection (where its concavity changes), you use the second derivative.
<BR>
<BR>If a function is concave up, it is curving in an upward direction. A parabola like $y=x^2$ <a href="http://learningflare.com/Calculus1/GraphsOfBasicFunctions/TextLesson/TextLesson.jsp" target="_blank">is</a> <span id="box1Trigger">curved upwards</span><span id="box1">The second derivative is the rate of change of the rate of change, so it's like the rate of change of the slope. When a slope changes, the result is a curved graph.</span>, so we say that it is "concave up." $y=-x^2$ is concave down.
<BR>
<BR>There is a little thing called the second derivative test. What we were using before to find local minima and maxima is called the "first derivative test."
<BR>
<BR>You use the second derivative test by finding the critical numbers the normal way, and then finding out if the second derivative is positive or negative at each of those points. <span id="box2Trigger">If the second derivative is 
<BR>positive, you have a minimum. If it's negative, you have a maximum.</span><span id="box2">One way to remember that negative $\Rightarrow$ maximum, and positive $\Rightarrow$ minimum, is to use these happy and sad faces:

<BR>
<BR>(<span id="box3Trigger">Example</span><span id="box3">If you had a curve with a critical point at $x=2$, and you found that its second derivative was $f''(x)=-x^2+1$, then $f''(2)=-(2)^2+1=-3$, and that would tell you that f has a maximum at $x=2$</span>)
<BR>
<BR>Now, to find where a point of inflection is, you do the exact same thing you did to find where a minimum or a maximum is, but with the second derivative instead of the first.$$f''(x)=(x^2-1)(4x-3)=0$$$$x=-1,\frac{3}{4},1$$You plot these on <span id="box4Trigger">a number line</span><span id="box4"><img src="../../Graphs/numberline3.1.png"></span>, then pick points in between. If the second derivative is positive, it's concave up, and if it's negative, it's concave down.
<BR>
<BR>Pick $x=-2$
<BR><span id="box5Trigger">$$f''(-2)=((-2)^2-1)(4(-2)-3)=(4-3)(-5)<0$$</span><span id="box5"><img src="../../Graphs/numberline3.2.png"></span>Pick $x=0$
<BR><span id="box6Trigger">$$f''(0)=(0^2-1)(4(0)-3)=(-)(-)>0$$</span><span id="box6"><img src="../../Graphs/numberline3.3.png"></span>
