<h3>3.14 - Linear Approximation</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->


<p>Linear approximation is using a line to approximate a number. Let's say we wanted to approximate <img src="../../Functions/image589.png" alt="sqrt2"> with linear approximation.</p>

<p>First, you take it apart: What is the number, and what is the function?</p>

x=2<br>
<img src="../../Functions/image591.png" alt="f(x)=x">

<p>Then you ask yourself, "What number close to 2 could I use for x that would be easy to figure out?" Well, 1 is close to 2, and 1=1, so let's use that. We call that a.</p>

a=1

<p>Then we plug our things into this formula:</p>

	<span class="B1">Linear approximation uses a tangent line at a point on a curve that is close to the point we are interested in. It traces the tangent line over to above or below where the actual point is, and it uses the y coordinate of the tangent line's point as an approximation for the y coordinate of the actual point. Of course if the curve happens to curve a lot, the linear approximation won't be that great. If you wanted to get more accurate, you could use a parabolic approximation, where not just 
the position and first derivative of the approximating curve are equal to the actual curve's position and first derivative, but the second derivative is as well. You learn more about this idea in Calculus 2 with Taylor Polynomials. They are pretty great.</span></a></p>

<p>That's the same thing we got the first time we did Newton's method on 2. But with <a href="#">Linear Approximation
	<span class="B1">I have used the idea of linear approximation on some of my own homework assignments to guess the right answer on certain problems, and it has saved me some points. It's pretty great.</span></a>, you only do it once. </p>
