Then we plug our things into this formula:
<BR>
<BR><span id="box1Trigger">$$f(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)$$</span><span id="box1">Linear approximation uses a tangent line at a point on a curve that is close to the point we are interested in. It traces the tangent line over to above or below the actual point, and it uses the y coordinate of the tangent line's point as an approximation for the y coordinate of the actual point. Of course if the curve happens to curve a lot, the linear approximation won't be that great. That's where Taylor polynomials are great.</span>$$f'(x)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}$$$$\sqrt{2}\approx \sqrt{1}+\frac{1}{2\sqrt{1}}(2-1)=1+\frac{1}{2}(1)=1.5$$That's the same thing we got the first time we did Newton's method on 2. But with <span id="box2Trigger">Linear Approximation</span><span id="box2">I have used the idea of linear approximation on some of my own homework assignments to guess the right answer on certain problems, and it has saved me some points. It's pretty straightforward.</span>, you only do it once.
