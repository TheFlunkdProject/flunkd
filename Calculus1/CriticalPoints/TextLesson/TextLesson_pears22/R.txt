What this process finds is called the relative <span id="box21Trigger">extrema</span><span id="box21">Minima or maxima</span> of $A$, or the local extrema of $A$. There are also things called global or absolute extrema. Those are a little easier to find, although a tiny bit more tedious sometimes. Those are the points where the function is at its absolute highest or lowest values, not where it is just <span id="box22Trigger">shaped like a maximum or a minimum</span><span id="box22">But this still could be where it happens.</span>. In the last problem we found where the function was shaped like a maximum, but we also found that after $x=-1/3$ the slope was positive forever and ever. It actually approaches infinity. So what we found was not the absolute maximum value. Just the local or relative maximum value.

<BR>So this is the process for finding absolute extrema of a function:<ol><li><span id="box23Trigger">Find the critical numbers inside the interval that you care about</span><span id="box23">Example: Find the absolute extrema of $f(x)=-x^3+8x^2+12x+3$ on the interval $[1,12]$: $$f'(x)=-3x^2+16x+12=0$$ $$3x2-16x-12=0$$ $$(3x+2)(x-6)=0$$ $$x=-3/2,6$$ $x=-3/2$ lies outside of the interval $[1,12]$, so we can discard it.</span></li><li><span id="box24Trigger">Plug in critical numbers and endpoints of the interval into the original equation, finding corresponding y-values for each of them</span><span id="box24">$$f(1)=-1^3+8(1)^2+12(1)+3$$ $$=-1+8+12+3=22$$$$f(6)=-6^3+8(6)^2+12(6)+3$$ $$=-216+288+72+3=147$$ $$f(12)=-12^3+8(12)^2+12(12)+3$$ $$=-1728+1152+144+3=-429$$</span>
<BR></li><li><span id="box25Trigger">Pick the ones that give you the highest and lowest values.</span><span id="box25">Absolute max: $$(6,147)$$ Absolute min:$$(12,-429)$$</span></li></ol>

<BR>This section takes a lot of practice to get the process down, so make sure you get that experience.
