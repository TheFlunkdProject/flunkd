<h3>3.11 - Critical Points</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->


<p>Critical points are all the points where the derivative of a function is either undefined, or zero, and in the domain of the original function. To find them, follow this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the derivative
</li>
<li>Find where the derivative equals zero or is undefined.
</li>
<li>Check that it is in the domain of the original function.
</li>
<li>Find the y coordinate of the point (because it is a critical point).
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Find the critical points of the function f(x)=x^2.</p>

<a href="#"><img src="../../Functions/image471.png" alt="f'(x)=2x=0, x=0">
	<span class="B1">Steps 1 and 2. x=0 is called a critical number. It's not a critical point because it's not a point.</span></a><br>

<a href="#">All x values are in the domain of x2<span class="B1"> Step 3.</span></a><br><br>

<a href="#"><img src="../../Functions/image472.png" alt="f(0)=0"><span class="B1">Step 4.</span></a><br><br>

<a href="#">Critical point: <img src="../../Functions/image473.png" alt="(0,0)"><span class="B1">This is the answer to the question.</span></a>

<p>Critical points have an extremely important application. You can use them to find <a href="#">extreme values of a function
	<span class="B1">minima and maxima</span></a>. When a function reaches a peak, it hits its maximum value, and right where it is at its highest point, <a href="#" class="L1">the slope is zero.<img src="../../Graphs/graphslopeofextrema.png" class="imgA1"></a>  That's why critical points can be used to find minima and maxima. But sometimes the slope can get to zero, then the function can just keep going up 
	<a href="#">without forming a peak<img src="../../Graphs/graphnoextrema.png" class="imgA1"></a>. So you need to make sure that the slope/derivative is <a href="#">positive before the critical number, and negative after it
	<span class="B1">for a minimum you want the opposite to happen: negative before, positive after</span></a>.</p>
	
	<p>Here is the process:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
<a href="#">Find the critical numbers
	<span class="B1">Example: <img src="../../Functions/image474.png" alt="A(x)=x3+2x2+x-7"></span></a>
	
	
<ol><br>
<li><a href="#">Find where the derivative is equal to zero or undefined
	<span class="B1"><img src="../../Functions/image475.png" alt="A'(x)=3x2+4x+1=0">,<img src="../../Functions/image476.png" alt="(">3x+1)(x+1)=0, <img src="../../Functions/image477.png" alt="x=-1/3,-1"></span></a>
</li>

<li><a href="#">Check that the critical numbers are in the domain
	<span class="B1">Or else they are not technically critical numbers. Our original function's domain is all x- values, so these are critical numbers.</span></a>
</li>
</ol>

<br>
</li>
	<li>
Find out where the slope/derivative is positive and negative
	


<ol><br>
<li><a href="#">Gather your critical numbers together, and plot them on a number line
	<span class="B1"><img src="../../Functions/image477.png" alt="x=-1/3,-1">, <img src="../../Graphs/numberline1.1.png" class="Floatright100"></span></a>
</li>

<li><a href="#">Plot every place where the original function is undefined on the same number line
	<span class="B1"> (because things like asymptotes affect the derivative.) <img src="../../Graphs/numberline1.2.png" class="Floatright100">Our original function's domain is all x- values, so we have nothing to add to our number line</span></a>
</li>

<li><a href="#">Pick any number between each of the numbers you plot on the number line and plug them into the derivative to find out if the derivative/slope is positive or negative in each of the intervals. This works because the derivative cannot change signs except for at those points.
	<span class="B1"><img src="../../Graphs/numberline1.3.png" class="Floatright100"> For the interval below x=-1, let's pick -2:
<img src="../../Functions/image478.png" alt="A'(-2)=3(-2)2+4(-2)+1=12-8+1>0">
So for that whole interval, the slope of <img src="../../Functions/image479.png" alt="A"> is positive. <img src="../../Functions/image479.png" alt="A"> is increasing.<br>

For the interval between x=-1 and <img src="../../Functions/image480.png" alt="x=-1/3">, let's try <img src="../../Functions/image481.png" alt="x=-2/3">.<br>

<img src="../../Functions/image482.png" alt="A'(-23)=3(-23)2+4(-23)+1=43-83+1=-43+33=-13<0">
So the slope is negative between <img src="../../Functions/image483.png" alt="-1/3"> and -1.

For the interval of <img src="../../Functions/image484.png" alt="x>-1/3">, let's pick 0 to try.<br>
<img src="../../Functions/image485.png" alt="A'(0)=0+0+1>0"></span></a>
</li>
</ol>
<br>


</li>
	<li>

<a href="#">Identify the max's and min's
	<span class="B1"><img src="../../Graphs/numberline1.4
	.png" class="Floatright100"> The slope of A is 	positive, then negative, then positive again. Where would the 	maximum value occur? Well, think about how a maximum is shaped. The 	slope is positive, then zero, then negative.@@Image of a maximum 	with three tangent lines drawn on it@@. So we pick the point where 	the derivative switches from being positive to being negative. That 	would be x=-1. The minimum is at <img src="../../Functions/image486.png" alt="x=-1/3">, but that's not 
	what this 	example is looki
ng for.</span></a>


</li><br>
	<li>

<a href="#">Plug the x numbers into the original function to find the y value (the maximum value of A)
	<span class="B1">Now we find the value of <img src="../../Functions/image479.png" 	alt="A"> at that number.<br>

	<img src="../../Functions/image487.png" alt="A(-1)=(-1)3+2(-1)2+(-1)-7=-1+2-1-7=-		7"><br>

	The local maximum value of <img src="../../Functions/image479.png" alt="A"> is <img 		src="../../Functions/image488.png" alt="-7">. <br>

	If they asked for the local maximum, it would be <img 	src="../../Functions/image489.png" alt="(-1,7)">. If they 		asked where the maximum occurs, the answer would be x=-1. But they 		asked for the local maximum value of A, and so the answer was the y 		coordinate of the maximum.
	If they asked, “Where is the function increasing and where is it 		decreasing?” your answer would look like this:<br><br>

	Increasing: <img src="../../Functions/image490.png" alt="(-13,inf)"> <br>
	Decreasing: <img src="../../Functions/image491.png" alt="(-inf,-1)U(-1,-1/3)"><br>

	They are all open parentheses because at each end point the function 	is neither increasing or decreasing; the derivative is just zero at 		the end points.</span></a>

<p>What this process finds is called the relative <a href="#">extrema
	<span class="B1">Minima or maxima</span></a>
 of A, or the local extrema of A. There are also things called global or absolute extrema. Those are a little easier to find, although a tiny bit more tedious sometimes. Those are the points where the function is at its absolute highest or lowest values, not where it is just <a href="#">shaped like a maximum or a minimum
	<span class="B1">But this is a common place for it to happen.</span></a>. In the last problem we found where the function was shaped like a maximum, but we also found that after x=-13 the slope was positive forever and ever. It actually approaches infinity. So what we found was not the absolute maximum value. Just the local or relative maximum value.</p>
	

<p>So this is the process for finding absolute extrema of a function:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#">Find the critical numbers inside the interval that you care about
	<span class="B1">Example: Find the absolute extrema of <img src="../../Functions/image492.png" alt="f(x)=-x3+8x2+12x+3"> on the interval <img src="../../Functions/image493.png" alt="[1,12]">: <img src="../../Functions/image494.png" alt="f'(x)=-3x2+16x+14=0, 3x2-16x-12=0, (3x+2)(x-6)=0,x=-32,6"> <img src="../../Functions/image495.png" alt="x=-3/2"> lies outside of the interval <img src="../../Functions/image493.png" alt="[1,12]">, so we can discard it.</span></a>
</li><br>
<li><a href="#">Plug in critical numbers and endpoints of the interval into the original equation, finding corresponding y- values for each of them
	<span class="B1"> <img src="../../Functions/image496.png" alt="f(1)=-13+8(1)2+12(1)+3=-1+8+12+3=22">
<img src="../../Functions/image497.png" alt="f(6)=-63+8(6)2+12(6)+3=-216+288+72+3=147">
<img src="../../Functions/image498.png" alt="f(12)=-123+8(12)2+12(12)+3=-1728+1152+144+3=-429"></span></a>
</li><br>
<li><a href="#">Pick the ones that give you the highest and lowest values.
	<span class="B1">Absolute max: <img src="../../Functions/image499.png" alt="(6,147)"> Absolute min: <img src="../../Functions/image500.png" alt="(12,-429)"></span></a>
</li>
</ol>



<p>This section takes a lot of practice to get the process down, so make sure you get that experience.</p>
