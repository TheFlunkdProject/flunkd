<h3>4.1 - Riemann Sums</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->


<p>If you have never used this symbol <img src="../../Functions/image595.png" alt="sum"> to sum things up, click here @@Link to summation notation in Algebra@@. Otherwise, keep reading.</p>

<p><a href="#">Here
	<span class="B1"><img src="../../Functions/image596.png" alt="i=57i3=53+63+73=125+216+343=341+343=684"></span></a> is a little reminder of 
<a href="#">how a sum works
	<span class="B1">Summation notation is very convenient way to write out a sum that follows a pattern, especially if it is an infinite sum and you don’t want to spend the rest of yours and your children’s lives writing out a sum. We will be doing infinite sums in the next section.</span></a>.</p>

<p>We want to find the the area under a curve. We do it by approximating the area with rectangles. This is what a Riemann Sum is. Since we will be using a bunch of rectangles for some of these, we represent the area using summation notation.</p>

<p>There are three common ways of drawing rectangles to approximate areas under curves: midpoint rectangles, Left endpoint rectangles, and right endpoint rectangles. </p>

<p>So, you take a curve like this one: <a href="#" class="L1">I am a CURVE!<img src="../../Graphs/graphriemann1.1.png" class="imgA1"></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the <a href="#" class="L1">starting and ending lines<img src="../../Graphs/graphriemann1.2.png" class="imgA1"></a> of your area.
</li>
<li>Divide it up into the number of sections you want to use. If you need <img src="../../Functions/image597.png" alt="n=4"> rectangles, make four sections by drawing 
<a href="#" class="L1">vertical lines equally spaced between your starting and ending lines.<img src="../../Graphs/graphriemann1.3.png" class="imgA1"></a>
</li>
<li>If you use left endpoint rectangles, go to the left side of each section. Follow the line up to where it touches the curve, 
and draw the line that goes on the top of the section <a href="#" class="L1">(i.e. from left to right)<img src="../../Graphs/graphriemann1.4.png" class="imgA1"></a>. This might make your rectangle above the curve or 
below the curve. After you do that to each rectangle, you find the area of each rectangle, and add them all together, and that 
gives you an approximation for the area under the curve. This is basic geometry and arithmetic once you figure out where your rectangles are.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The formulas go like this:</p>

<img src="../../Functions/image598.png" alt="A=i=1nf(xi)x"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image599.png" alt="xi=a+(i-1)x"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image601.png" alt="x=b-an">





<img src="../../Functions/image598.png" alt="A=i=1nf(xi)x">
<img src="../../Functions/image602.png" alt="xi=a+(i-12)x">
<img src="../../Functions/image601.png" alt="x=b-an">

<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->

<p>For right endpoint rectangles, you do the same thing but when you draw your rectangles <a href="#" class="L1">you use the right 
side of each section<img src="../../Graphs/graphriemann1.5.png" class="imgA1"></a> 
to make your rectangles.</p>

<p>The formulas for right endpoint rectangles look like this:</p>

<img src="../../Functions/image598.png" alt="A=i=1nf(xi)x">
xi=a+ix
<img src="../../Functions/image601.png" alt="x=b-an">

<p>Midpoint method is pretty similar too. Instead of going to the right or left sides of your sections, <a href="#" class="L1">you go to the exact middle and 
go straight up from there and draw lines to the left and right to complete you rectangle<img src="../../Graphs/graphriemann1.6.png" class="imgA1"></a>. This method is usually more accurate.</p>

<p>Here are the formulas:</p>

<p>What's different between the three methods? Just the formula for <img src="../../Functions/image603.png" alt="xi">. So you basically have 5 things to remember. <img src="../../Functions/image604.png" alt="deltax"> makes sense, because it is just the width of each rectangle. <img src="../../Functions/image598.png" alt="A=i=1nf(xi)x"> also makes sense because it is the sum of the widths times the heights of a bunch of rectangles. If you think about the three formulas for <img src="../../Functions/image603.png" alt="xi">, they make sense too. </p>

<p>You should memorize these formulas because we are going to use them in the next section, except we will be taking the limit as n approaches infinity in order to get infinitely accurate.</p>
