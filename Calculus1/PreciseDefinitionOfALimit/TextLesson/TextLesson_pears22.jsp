<h3>2.8 - Precise Definition of a Limit</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2F%2528%25CE%25B5%2C_%25CE%25B4%2529-definition_of_limit%23Precise_statement&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHMj5Hcjnpi0argMMAnJsocxgdpYA" >Here</a> 
is the precise definition of a limit. The Greek you see is 
<img src="../../Functions/image187.png" > (delta) and <img src="../../Functions/image188.png" > (epsilon).</p>
<p>In the following limit, x is approaching a, and y is approaching L:</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image190.png" >
<p>In limits, we are examining values that are super close to what x and y are 
approaching. The distance that x is away from a is represented by <img src="../../Functions/image187.png" >, 
and the distance y is away from L is <img src="../../Functions/image188.png" >. <img src="../../Functions/image187.png" > and <img src="../../Functions/image188.png" > 
both change, and approach zero when you evaluate the limit. But they always have a 
relationship to each other in size. For this line<a href="#">
<img src="../../Functions/image191.png" ><img src="graph3x+2.png" class="imgA1"></a>, 
<img src="../../Functions/image192.png" > on any part of the line.</p>
<p>There are two types of <img src="../../Functions/image193.png" > problems: </p>
<ol>
<li>A problem where you are given an  and you need to find a </li>
<li>A limit that you need to prove using the precise definition of a limit</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm going to be lazy for now and refer you to the Video Explanations. :)</p>
