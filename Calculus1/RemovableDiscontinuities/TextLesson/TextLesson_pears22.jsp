<h3>2.2 - Removable Discontinuities</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->

When you try to evaluate a limit and you get <img src="../../Functions/image96.png" alt="0/0"> , you have run into what is called a "removable discontinuity." 
<br><br>Example: <img src="../../Functions/image97.png" alt="evaluating limit">
<br><br>What this means is that there is something in the numerator and denominator that is making them both 0 when you plug 1 in for x. But <img src="../../Functions/image96.png" alt="0/0"> is not what the limit really equals. You need to go back to the original limit, and factor everything completely until you can cancel something out.
<p>Once you cancel out the thing that was causing problems, you will be able to evaluate the
limit like normal:</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image98.png">
<p>So even though we got <img src="../../Functions/image96.png"> when we plugged in the limit the first time, the limit really equals 2. Again, this is called a removable discontinuity.</p>
<p><a href="#">Here<img src="../../Functions/image98.2.png" class="imgA1"></a> is what a removable discontinuity looks like.</p>
<p>It's just a hole in the graph. The curve is non-existent at <img src="../../Functions/image99.png">. <img src="../../Functions/image100.png"> does not exist. This is where limits are important.
The limit tells you where the curve would be if it weren't for that hole. It tells you what all of the y values close to x=2 are approaching.
That is what limits are used for. If we can't figure out what a function is doing exactly at a point, the
limit will tell us what the numbers extremely close to it are leading to.</p>
