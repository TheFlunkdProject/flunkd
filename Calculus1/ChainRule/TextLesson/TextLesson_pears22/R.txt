<p>So the trick is to start on the very outside, and work your way inside. You start with the main form of 
the whole expression, and pretend anything inside of it is an x. Then, you multiply by the derivative of 
what was inside that you were pretending was an x, and so on, until what is on the inside is actually an x. 
Like this:</p>
