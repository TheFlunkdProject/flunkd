<h3>3.1 - Definition of the Derivative</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->


<p>The derivative is the coolest, most important, and most applicable aspect of 
calculus. You will need to understand what a derivative is for pretty much everything
that comes after this.</p>
<p>A derivative is a rate of change. For the graph of a curve, it represents the <a href="#">slope
<span class="B1">Slope is a rate of change. It is the rate of change in y over the change 
in x, which is also the rise over run.</span></a>. 
It allows us to find the instantaneous slope at any point of a <a href="#">differentiable
<span class="B1">differentiable means it has no sharp points or cusps and is continuous.<br><br>
<img src="../../Graphs/graphnondif1.png" class="Floatleft100">This graph is non-differentiable at 1 beacuse it has a sharp point/cusp.<br><br><br><br><br>
<img src="../../Graphs/graphnondif2.png" class="Floatright100">This graph is non-differentiable at 2 and 5 beacuse 
it is discontinuous at 2 and 5. It has asymptotes there.</span></a> curve.</p>
<p>The derivative of a function is denoted in two ways: <img src="../../Functions/image195.png"> and 
<img src="../../Functions/image196.png">.</p>
<p>The formula for the derivative of a function is:</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image197.png">
<p>Let's say we want to know the slope of the curve of <img src="../../Functions/image202.png"> at <img src="../../Functions/image198.png">. 
The formula will give us the derivative, which will help us find the slope of 
x^2 at any x value. The formula for the derivative returns an expression <a href="#">
in terms of x<span class="B1">Hence <i>f'(x)</i></span></a>. Pay special attention to 
how we plug in <img src="../../Functions/image199.png">.</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image200.png"> <a href="#">Removable Discontinuity<span class="B1">It turns out 
that every time you find a derivative with this formula, it is a removable discontinuity. 
So you don't need to plug in <i>h</i> every time. You know you're just going to have to start over 
and simplify anyway, so just start simplifying from the beginning.</span></a><br>

<p>So the slope of <img src="../../Functions/image202.png"> at <img src="../../Functions/image198.png"> is:</p>

<p>Here is the graph of <img src="../../Functions/image202.png"> to prove it:</p>

<p>There are two tricky problems that you will always see when you are taking derivatives 
using this formula: fraction functions and root functions. Make sure you check out the 
examples of those.</p>
