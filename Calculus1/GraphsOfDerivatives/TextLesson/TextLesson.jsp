<h3>3.2 - Graphs of Derivatives</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->

<p>A function is <a href="#">differentiable
	<span class="B1">differentiable means it has no sharp points or cusps and is continuous.<br>
<img src="../../Graphs/graphnondif1.png" class="Floatleft100">This graph is non-differentiable at 1 beacuse it has a sharp point/cusp.<br><br><br>
<img src="../../Graphs/graphnondif2.png" class="Floatright100">This graph is non-differentiable at 2 and 5 beacuse 
it is discontinuous at 2 and 5.
	</span></a> at a number if it is continuous there, and does not have a sharp point or 
cusp there.</p>

<p>You can take derivatives of derivatives. The common notation looks like this:</p>
<a href="#"><img src="../../Functions/image240.png">, 
	<span class="B1">First derivative of <i>f</i>
	</span></a>, 
<a href="#"><img src="../../Functions/image241.png">
	<span class="B1">Second derivative of <i>f</i>
	</span></a>, 
<a href="#"><img src="../../Functions/image242.png">
	<span class="B1">Third derivative of <i>f</i>
	</span></a>, 
<a href="#"><img src="../../Functions/image243.png">
	<span class="B1">Fourth derivative of <i>f</i>
	</span></a><br>
and so on.

<p>This is a typical problem involving identifying multiple derivatives of functions on a graph:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Identify <img src="../../Functions/image240.png">, <img src="../../Functions/image241.png">, and <img src="../../Functions/image242.png">:
</li>
</ul>
<img src="../../Graphs/graphidentifyder.png" style="border: 5px ridge grey; width:40%; height:35%; float:right;">
<br>
<p>You need to use the meaning of the derivative to figure these out. The derivative is the slope. 
The slope of one function becomes the y value of its derivative. So, the slope of <i>f</i> at a place 
will be the y-coordinate of <img src="../../Functions/image244.png"> at the same place, and the slope of <img src="../../Functions/image244.png"> at a place 
will be the y-coordinate of <img src="../../Functions/image245.png"> at the same place. </p>

<p>In our <a href="#">graph<img src="../../Graphs/graphidentifyder.png" class="imgA1"></a>, I would look at the place on the right where the green curve has a horizontal tangent (slope=0).
I would expect green's derivative to cross zero at that same x-value. And it looks like both blue and red do. 
So I know that either red is the derivative of green, or blue is. On the other side where blue has a horizontal 
tangent line, its derivative should be zero. Both green and red cross zero. So either green is the derivative 
of blue, or red is.</p>
<p>So the information points to either original=green, first derivative=blue, second derivative=red, or 
original=green, first derivative=red, second derivative=blue. Let's make a guess and check it at some random point.
Look at x=-2. Let's say green is the original. It's slope looks like it's about negative two. So is the position 
of one of the other lines at y=-2? Blue is down there. Now, what is the slope of blue? It likes like 1.5 ish. 
Is red at y=1.5? It's about there. So the answer is: <img src="../../Functions/image241.png">=green, <img src="../../Functions/image242.png">=blue, and <img src="../../Functions/image243.png">=red.</p>


<p>It's a strange concept to visualize at first, but it gets easier. Just have patience and be very deliberate at first. 
There are many ways to come up with the answer if you analyze the problem long enough.</p>

<p>It easiest to use significant features of one to look at the others. Find places where 
the slope is zero on one curve, and look for other curves that cross the x-axis at the 
same place. If there are any, then they are probably the derivative of the curve with 
the zero slope.</p>

<p>Final note: The derivative of a function does not take into consideration the height 
of the function, but <a href="#">only its shape
   <span class="B1">The value of a slope of a 
line has nothing to do with how high the line is above the x-axis. So the 
derivative will not care what the vertical positioning of the original curve was, 
since it is a graph of the values of the slopes.
