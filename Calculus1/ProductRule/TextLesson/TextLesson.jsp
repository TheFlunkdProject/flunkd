<h3>3.5 - Product Rule</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->


<p>When you take the derivative of a product, you can use the product rule. This is the formula for it:</p>

<p>It can also be written as <img src="../../Functions/image256.png" alt="(fg)'=fg'+f'g"></p>
<p>But donâ€™t pay too much attention to that, even if you're a formula person. Just remember that when 
you have two things with variables inside of them multiplied by each other, each of them takes a turn 
having its derivative taken, and you add both terms together. Like this:</p>

<p>Notice that we could have simplified this first and gotten the same answer:</p>

<p>This is a lot easier to do. Whenever you can do algebra before calculus, DO IT! It makes life a lot better 
for everyone.</p>
<p>You can still do the product rule when there are more than 2 products. The idea is to group everything 
into two main groups, do the product rule on them, then when you go inside each group you will need another 
product rule:</p>
