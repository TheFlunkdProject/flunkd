<h3>3.10 - Related Rates</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->

<p>Related rates are delicious applications of derivatives/rates of change. Unfortunately, they are difficult to set up. So pay special attention to how to set them up.</p>

<p>You always go through this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right down the information in math language</p>
<li>Come up with an equation that relates all of the variables/constants 
in your information</li>
<li>Take the derivative</li>
<li>Solve for the rate you need</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is an example of a basic related rates problem:</p>

<p>A balloon is being blown up at a rate of 18<img src="../../Functions/image344.png" alt="cm^3/s">. How fast is the radius of the balloon increasing when the radius is 5<img src="../../Functions/image345.png" alt="cm">?</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<ol>
<li>Since the balloon is increasing in size, the volume is increasing. 
When a quantity increases, you can represent that change with a derivative. 
So the first part tells us that <a href="#" class="L1"><img src="../../Functions/image346.png" alt="dVdt=18cm3/s"><span class="B1">The rates in virtually all related rates problems are all about how 
fast something is happening. So that means that in every related rates problem you will see, the derivatives will be taken with respect to time.  That is a change in something over a change in time.</span></a>.

<br><br>We also have <img src="../../Functions/image347.png" alt="r=5cm">. What do we need to find? How fast the radius is increasing. That is also a derivative. <img src="../../Functions/image348.png" alt="dr/dt=">?
</li>

<li>
What is an equation that relates a radius with the volume of a sphere? Well, that would be the volume of a sphere equation.

</li>

</ol>

<li>
When we take the derivative with related rates, we do it with respect to time. So we treat <i>t</i> like <i>x</i>, and the other variables like their own kind of <i>y</i>. That means implicit differentiation.<br>

What do we need to find? <img src="../../Functions/image353.png" alt="dr/dt">.<br>
<img src="../../Functions/image354.png" alt="dVdt(14r2)=drdt"><br><br>
It is only after the derivative that we can plug in the information for the specific moment we want, which is <img src="../../Functions/image355.png" alt="r=5">. We also know <img src="../../Functions/image356.png" alt="dVdt=18">.<br>
<img src="../../Functions/image357.png" alt="18(14*25)=drdt"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image358.png" alt="drdt=950cm/s">
</li>
</ol>

<p>The expanding sphere problem is very common on tests and in homework. A lot of related rates problems tend to get reused often.</p>
