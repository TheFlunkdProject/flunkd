$$V=\frac{4}{3}\pi\,r^3$$<ol start="3"><li>When we take the derivative with related rates, we do it with respect to time. So we treat <i>t</i> like <i>x</i>, and the other variables like their own kind of <i>y</i>. That makes it implicit differentiation.$$\frac{dV}{dt}=\frac{4}{3}\pi\, 3r^2\frac{dr}{dt}$$$$\frac{dV}{dt}=4\pi r^2\frac{dr}{dt}$$</li><li>What do we need to find? $\frac{dr}{dt}$ $$\frac{dV}{dt}(\frac{1}{4\pi r^2})=\frac{dr}{dt}$$ It is only after the derivative that we can plug in the information for the specific moment we want, which is $r=5$. We also know $\frac{dV}{dt}=18$, but we wouldn't be tempted to plug that into anything until after the derivative anyway.$$18(\frac{1}{4\pi*25})=\frac{dr}{dt}$$$$\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{9}{50\pi}\,cm/s$$</li></ol>

<BR>The expanding sphere problem is very common on tests and in homework. Actually, a lot of related rates problems tend to get reused often.
