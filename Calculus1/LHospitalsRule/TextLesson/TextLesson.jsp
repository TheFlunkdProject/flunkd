<h3>3.8 - L'Hospital's Rule</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->

<p>Derivatives were made possible because of limits, and L'Hospital's rule is derivatives' 
way of giving back to limits.</p>
<p>When you evaluate a limit and you get one of these two indeterminate forms:</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image283.png">, <img src="../../Functions/image96.png" alt="0/0">

<p>you can use L'Hospital's rule. If you get an indeterminate limit of any other form, 
you have to change the expression into something that will give you one of these two forms.
The way to use L'Hospital's Rule is simple. Take the derivative of the top and the 
derivative of the bottom. This is <a href="#">not the quotient rule.
   <span class="B1">Everyone at some point makes the mistake of wanting to do the 
quotient rule. Watch out for that.</span></a> It is easier. Example:
<a href="#"><img src="../../Functions/image284.png"><span class="B1">Like always, the first thing you 
do is plug in the limit. Now we can use L'Hospital's Rule.</span></a>
<p><img src="../../Functions/image285.png"> <p>We can pretty much do L'Hospital's Rule over and over until 
the x's are gone from either the numerator or the denominator.</p>
