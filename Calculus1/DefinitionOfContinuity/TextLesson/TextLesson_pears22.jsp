<h3>2.6 - Definition of Continuity</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->

<p>Any function <img src="../../Functions/image181.png"> is continuous at 
<a href="#">a number <img src="../../Functions/image182.png"><span class="B1">
An x-value of course, because the word "at" is being used. 
That usually refers to x-values.</span></a> if 
<img src="../../Functions/image183.png"></p>
<p>An example of a function that is not continuous 
is <img src="../../Functions/image184.png">. It is not continuous 
because it has an asymptote at 0, where there is 
a break in the curve. But we can test our definition 
of continuity on it:</p>

<p>We already know that this is discontinuous because it would 
be impossible for us to find a limit that equals "undefined".</p>
<p>If you have a picture of a graph to look at, you can easily see 
where a function is discontinuous. The curve breaks or has a hole. 
Here are three examples:</p>
<a href="#">Discontinuous; removable discontinuity<image src="../../Graphs/graphContin1.png" class="imgA1"></a><br>
<a href="#">Discontinuous; "jump discontinuity"<image src="../../Graphs/graphContin2.png" class="imgA1"></a><br>
<a href="#">Continuous<image src="../../Graphs/graphContin3.png" class="imgA1"></a>
