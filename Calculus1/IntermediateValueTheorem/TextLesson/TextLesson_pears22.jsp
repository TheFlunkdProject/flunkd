<h3>2.7 - Intermediate Value Theorem</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->


<h4>The Intermediate Value Theorem states:</h4>

<p>"If  <i>f</i> is a real-valued continuous function on the interval <img src="../../Functions/image432.png" alt="[a,b]">, and <img src="../../Functions/image433.png" alt="u"> is a number between <img src="../../Functions/image434.png" alt="f(a)"> and <img src="../../Functions/image435.png" alt="f(b)">, then there is a numberc in the interval <img src="../../Functions/image432.png" alt="[a,b]"> such that <img src="../../Functions/image436.png" alt="u=f(c)">"</p>

<p>When you understand what this means, it is pretty intuitive. </p>

<p>Let's say you want to know if a curve crosses the x-axis ever. If you picked two random x values, <img src="../../Functions/image437.png" alt="x=a"> and <img src="../../Functions/image438.png" alt="x=b">, and plugged them into the function and got a positive number for <i>a</i> and a negative number for <i>b</i>, you would know that the curve would have to cross the x-axis somewhere in between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, or else it could never change from positive to negative.</p>

<p>In this application of the Intermediate Value Theorem, our <img src="../../Functions/image433.png" alt="u"> was 0. <img src="../../Functions/image433.png" alt="u"> is a <i>y</i> value because it is between <a href="#"><img src="../../Functions/image434.png" alt="f(a)"> and <img src="../../Functions/image435.png" alt="f(b)">
	<span class="B1">Also <i>y</i> values</span></a>. Our <i>a</i> was <i>a</i> and our <i>b</i> was <i>b</i>, and our <i>c</i> was - well it doesn't matter what it was. We just know that it exists. The purpose of <i>c</i> is that it is the x value where our function takes on the value of u. <img src="../../Functions/image440.png" alt="f(c)=u">. The Intermediate Value Theorem is only used to prove the existence of at least one of those kinds of <i>c</i> numbers (it doesn't say there is <i>only</i> one of them, just that 
	there is one).</p>

<p>If there were no number <i>c</i> such that <img src="../../Functions/image436.png" alt="u=f(c)">, that would mean that there was an asymptote or some other kind of discontinuity.  That's why the Intermediate Value Theorem is conditional upon the function being continuous. If the function is not continuous on the <a href="#">closed interval <img src="../../Functions/image432.png" alt="[a,b]">
	<span class="B1">The interval from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> including both <i>a</i> and <i>b</i></span></a>, the theorem does not apply. That is super important. You should read that again. </p>

<p>The Intermediate Value Theorem isn't the most important theorem, but it can be a useful tool sometimes. </p>
