<h3>2.5 - Infinite Limits</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->


<p>When you evaluate any limit, you can get one of four things:</p>
<ol>
<li>a finite number</li>
<li>Infinity (+ or -)</li>
<li>Nothing (DNE)</li>
<li>Indeterminate (Like <img src="../../Functions/image96.png" alt="0/0"></li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever you get an indeterminate limit, you want to 
change the form of whatever you have into something that 
will make the limit become one of the other three possible 
results. </p>
<p>Here are all of the indeterminate forms:</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image163.png">

<p>The following technique can be used when you 
<a href="#">get<span class="B1">But you can pretty much 
always manipulate the function in order to make the limit 
give you the first two indeterminate forms.</span></a>
 an indeterminate limit of the first two forms.</p>
<p>This technique involves identifying the most 
powerful exponent the denominator, then dividing 
the top and bottom of the fraction by that power. 
Here is an example:</p>
<a href="#"><img src="../../Functions/image164.png">
<span class="B1">The biggest power in the denominator is x^1. 
So we divide everything by x.</span></a>
<a href="#"><img src="../../Functions/image164.2.png"><span class="B1">
When you plug in infinity, whatever term in there that 
has an x in the denominator will go to zero. This is 
because when you divide by infinity, you get zero.</span></a>

<p>Here is another example:</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image167.1.png">
<img src="../../Functions/image167.2.png">
<img src="../../Functions/image167.3.png">
<p>Ultimately the only terms that matter are the terms 
with the biggest powers.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can <a href="#">use your knowledge
<span class="B1">For example:<br>
<img src="../../Functions/image168.png"><br>
We know this because as x approaches infinity, it 
approaches the horizontal asymptote, and the horizontal 
asymptote for this function is at <img src="../../Functions/image169.png">. 
It's the same for negative infinity:<br><img src="../../Functions/image170.png"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image171.png"> (Horizontal asymptote at <img src="../../Functions/image172.png">)<br>
For diagonal/oblique asymptotes, it's just better to use 
the new limit trick you just learned.</span></a>
 of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_asymptotes#Horizontal_asymptotes">
horizontal asymptotes</a> to find infinite limits faster.</p>
