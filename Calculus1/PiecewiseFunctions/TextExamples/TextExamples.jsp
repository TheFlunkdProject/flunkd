<p>Notice that the highest power here is with the x^2.
But since it is underneath the square root, it counts 
as half that. So we multiply by 1 over x, and when 
it enters square root land it becomes 1 over x squared.</p>

</ul>
<p>This example seems to always be asked in homework or on test:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#"><img src="../../Functions/image180.png"><span class="B1">
<p>So the first thing we do, as always, is plug in our 
limit. We get infinity minus infinity. That is one of 
the indeterminate forms and tells us we need to change 
something about it. We want to turn it into a fraction 
so we can treat it like a normal infinite limit like 
weâ€™ve been dealing with. This is a special trick that 
you just have to remember if you come across something 
like this. Turn it into a fraction and then multiply 
top and bottom by the conjugate.</p></span></a><br>

<a href="#"><img src="../../Functions/image180.3.png"><span class="B1">
<p>Since the x's are positive and in the denominator 
and not the numerator, the denominator approaches infinity 
while the numerator stays at 1 and so the limit equals 0.</p>
