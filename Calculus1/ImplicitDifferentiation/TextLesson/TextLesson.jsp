<h3>3.9 - Implicit Differentiation</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->

<p>Implicit differentiation is an interesting differentiating technique that makes the 
derivatives of certain functions possible that weren't before. It also has an application 
in one of the most awesome calculus applications called "related rates." It represents a 
concept that stretches calculus beyond the simple calculus that you have learned so 
far. If you learn this well, you will learn a lot of math in the future more easily.</p>
<p>Implicit differentiation is what you use when you have an equation which is not solved 
for y. You take the derivatives of the y's as if they were x's,  but each time you do, you 
multiply by the chain rule for y which happens to be y' or dydx. You then solve the new 
equation for the <img src="../../Functions/image287.png"> or dy/dx. Here are some examples:</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image288.png" alt="y+x=x2"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image289.png" alt="y'+1=2x"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image290.png" alt="y'=2x-1">

<p>If your original equation can be solved for y, it is good to plug it into the y's in 
the derivative. Here is an example of this:</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image291.png" alt="x2-y2=9"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image292.png" alt="2x-2ydydx=0"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image293.png" alt="dydx=-2x-2y=xy">
<h5>Now solve for y in the original:</h5>
<img src="../../Functions/image294.png" alt="x2-9=y2"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image295.png" alt="y=x2-9">

<h5>Substitute y into the derivative:</h5>
<img src="../../Functions/image296.png" alt="dydx=xx2-9">

<p>Sometimes you don't need to solve for <img src="../../Functions/image195.png"> or <img src="../../Functions/image287.png"> at all. That's 
only when you have numbers to plug in. </p>
<h5>Example:</h5>
<p>Find the slope of the curve <img src="../../Functions/image296.png" alt="x2+e3y=5"> at the point 
<img src="../../Functions/image298.png" alt="(2,0)">.</p>
<h4>Solution:</h4>
<p>Since the derivative is where you find the slope, you take that first:</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image299.png" alt="2x+e3y3y'=0">
<p>Now we can just plug in the point:</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image300.png" alt="2(2)+e03y'=0"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image301.png" alt="y'=-4/3">
