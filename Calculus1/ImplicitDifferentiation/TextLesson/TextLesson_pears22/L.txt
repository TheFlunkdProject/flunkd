Implicit differentiation is an interesting differentiating technique that makes the derivatives of certain functions possible that weren't before. It also has an application 
in one of the most awesome calculus topics called "related rates." If you learn this well, you will learn a lot of math in the future more easily.

Implicit differentiation is what you use when you have an equation which is not solved for $y$. You take the derivatives of the $y$'s as if they were $x$'s,  but each time you do, you multiply by the chain rule for $y$ which happens to be $y$' or $\frac{dy}{dx}$. You then solve the new equation for the $y'$ or $\frac{dy}{dx}$. Here are some examples: $$y+x=x^2$$ $$y'+1=2x$$ $$y'=2x-1$$If your original equation can be solved for $y$, it is good to plug it into the $y$'s in the derivative. Here is an example of this:$$x^2-y^2=9$$ $$2x-2y\frac{dy}{dx}=0$$ $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{-2x}{-2y}=\frac{x}{y}$$
