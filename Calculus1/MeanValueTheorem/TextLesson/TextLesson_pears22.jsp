<h3>3.15 - Mean Value Theorem</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->


<p>The Mean Value Theorem states:</p>

<p>If f is a continuous function on <img src="../../Functions/image432.png" alt="[a,b]">, and is differentiable on <img src="../../Functions/image455.png" alt="(a,b)">, then there exists a <i>c</i> in <img src="../../Functions/image455.png" alt="(a,b)"> such that <a href="#"><img src="../../Functions/image456.png" alt="f'(c)=f(b)-f(a)b-a.">
	<span class="B1"> This is the formula for the slope of a line. In this case, it's referring to a secant line. It looks like this: @@Image of what a secant line is@@</span></a>.</p>

<p>The theorem is basically saying that <a href="#" class="L1">if you pick two points on a continuous function, then the average slope of the 
function between those two points will equal the exact slope at at least one place in between them.<img src="../../Graphs/graphmeanvalue.png" class="imgA1"></a>


<p>Usually they want you to find the value of <i>c</i>.</p>

<h4>Rolle's Theorem</h4>

<p>Rolle's Theorem is a special case of the Mean Value Theorem. It happens when the right side of <img src="../../Functions/image456.png" alt="f'(c)=f(b)-f(a)b-a."> equals zero. It has the <a href="#">same two hypotheses as the Mean Value Theorem
	<span class="B1"> If f is a continuous function on <img src="../../Functions/image432.png" alt="[a,b]">, and is differentiable on <img src="../../Functions/image455.png" alt="(a,b)">, . . ."</span></a>, but the third is the one that makes it more specific: <a href="#"><img src="../../Functions/image458.png" alt="f(b)=f(a)">
	<span class="B1">Just for  for Rolle's Theorem.</span></a></p>

<p>Remember about all of these theorems, that if the conditions are not met, the theorem does not apply.</p>
