<h3>1.5 - Fractions</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->
<p>There are a couple of skills that we use in calculus all the time that deal with fractions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Simplifying fractions</li>
<li>Adding fractions</li>
</ol>
<h5>1. Simplifying Fractions</h5>
<img src="../../Functions/image53.png" alt="4/2=" >
<p>That is how it is done. You need to know 
how numbers factor in order to reduce fractions all the way. 
If the numerator and denominator have any common factor, 
you can cancel it.</p>
<p>What if you have two terms in the top of a fraction? 
Like with <img src="../../Functions/image54.png" alt="2+1/2=" >. Can you cancel the twos?</p>
<p>No. In order to cancel something in a fraction, it has 
to be in every term. If you canceled the 2's, you would get 
<img src="../../Functions/image55.png" alt="2+1/2=1+1/2"  >.
But <a href="#"   ><img src="../../Functions/image56.png" alt="2+1/2=3/2" >.
      <span class="B1">
      Here is a tip for any algebraic operation you perform, but are not sure you are 
      allowed to: Plug in simple numbers and solve it both ways to see if you are breaking 
      rules. Try it again with different numbers if you get the same thing but still are 
      not sure if what you are doing is legal.

<p>One more thing with simplifying fractions. One of the 
biggest pains is having to simplify fractions within 
fractions. Here is a great example that I guaranty you 
will see in the Definition of Derivatives section of 
calculus:</p>

<p>You should simplify it until you have one simple fraction 
for an answer. This is the first way of doing that, which 
takes one extra step, but is the most common way.</p>
   <a href="#"  ><img src="../../Functions/image57.1.png"><img src="../../Functions/image57.2.png"><img src="../../Functions/image57.3.png">
      <span class="B1" style="color:#FFFFFF;font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;">

      It involves getting a common denominator on the top, 
      then flipping and multiplying the <img src="../../Functions/image58.png" alt=""> 
      that is in the denominator.

      </span>
   </a>
<p>This is the slightly shorter way of doing that: </p>
   <a href="#"  ><img src="../../Functions/image58.1.png"><img src="../../Functions/image58.2.png"><img src="../../Functions/image58.3.png">
      <span class="B1">

      Just multiply the top and bottom of the original thing by the common denominator you 
      would have gotten, and all things will work out nicely.

      </span>
   </a>

<h5>2. Adding Fractions</h5>
<p>To add two fractions, you need the denominators of both 
of them to be the same. Usually they are not and you need 
to make them that way. Here are two examples of adding 
fractions:
</p>
<p><img src="../../Functions/image60.png" alt=""></p>
   <a href="#"  ><img src="../../Functions/image61.png" alt="">
      <span class="B1">

      The denominator is the first thing you worry about. Make it the same by multiplying 
      one or both fractions by something over something, then once the denominators are the 
      same, you can add the numerators.
