Newton's method is a way to approximate roots of equations. It is a formula that iterates, so the more times you put your number through the formula, the closer your number gets to the root of the equation. Here is the formula:
<BR><div class="importantExpression">$x_{n+1}=x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$</div>
<BR>
<BR>So this formula uses a derivative.
<BR>
<BR>Here is an example of how to use it:
<BR>
<BR>Use Newton's method three times to approximate the root of this equation starting with $x=1$: $$f(x)=x^2-2$$Solution:
<BR>
<BR>First, find $f'(x)$:$$f'(x)=2x$$
