With the equation, $x_1=1$ because $n=1$ is what corresponds to the first value. The formula finds the $(n+1)$th number, so it finds the one after the one you are plugging in. We can plug in $x_1$ now and we will find $x_2$.$$x_2=1-\frac{(1)^2-2}{2(1)}=1+\frac{1}{2}=1.5$$$$x_3=1.5-\frac{1.5^2-2}{2(1.5)}=1.416667">$$$$x_4=1.416667-\frac{1.416667^2-2}{2(1.416667)}=1.414216$$That was three times, which is what they asked for. Notice what we just did. We just found the root of $x^2-2$. That means we found out what x is when $x^2-2=0$, or $x=\sqrt{2}$. So we basically came up with an approximation for $\sqrt{2}$. Compare what we came up with, $1.414216$, to the actual number $sqrt{2}=1.414124$... That's pretty close, and we didn't have to use a calculator (because we know how to divide and multiply numbers). So, if you were stranded on an island somewhere, and for some reason you had to know what $\sqrt{2}$ was in order to survive, you could calculate it. The ancient Babylonians actually used a similar formula to calculate it. I'm not sure their lives depended on it, though. They just wanted to.

<BR>There are some problems with Newton's method, however. And you can know how to avoid them if you understand how they arise. Check out the videos to learn about that.
