<h3>2.3 - One-Sided Limits</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->


<p>You can approach an x value from two directions: negative or positive (left or right). 
Limits are always approaching from both sides simultaneously, unless it looks like this:
</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image110.png">
<p>The plus sign to the top right corner of the 2 that x is approaching means that 
x is approaching 2 <a href="#">from the right.<span class="B1">If it were a negative sign, x would approach 
2 from the left.</span></a>
</p>
<p>This is used in two situations: Asymptotic functions and piecewise functions. 
In this section, we are looking at asymptotic functions. 
</p>
<p>Here is how to evaluate them:</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image111.png">
<p>This is an undefined number, so it is not really the limit. That means that at <img src="../../Functions/image112.png">, 
there is a vertical asymptote. When curves have vertical asymptotes, the curves approach 
positive infinity or negative infinity as they get closer to their asymptotes. 
So when you are plugging in a limit and you get zero on the bottom of a fraction AND not 
in the top, your limit will equal infinity, negative infinity, or <a href="#">DNE<span class="B1">does not exist</span></a>.
</p>
<p>If your limit is a one-sided limit, it will equal positive or negative infinity.</p>

<p>To find out if your one-sided limit is approaching positive infinity or
negative infinity at an asymptote, plug in numbers that are ridiculously close to what x 
is approaching.</p>

<p>And that would be the answer. <a href="#">Here is another example.<span class="B1">

You usually actually have to break out one-sided limits yourself, so here is when you would 
need to do that:
<img src="../../Functions/image119.png">    Undefined;
<p>Have x approach <a href="#">from the right and left:<span class="B1">Find <img src="../../Functions/image120.png"> and <img src="../../Functions/image121.png"></span></a>
</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image120.png">: <img src="../../Functions/image122.png"> so <img src="../../Functions/image123.png"> 
<img src="../../Functions/image121.png">:  <img src="../../Functions/image124.png"> so <img src="../../Functions/image125.png">
<p>Notice how one is positive infinity and the other is negative infinity. That means that 
the answer to <img src="../../Functions/image126.png"> is DNE or "Does not exist." When the one-sided limits 
disagree, this will be the answer.</p>

<p>If you were to get the same answer for both the positive and negative sides of <img src="../../Functions/image127.png">, 
then whatever that same answer was would be the answer for the main limit.</p>
<a href="#">Here is an example of that.<span class="B1" style="height:380;">
<img src="../../Functions/image128.png">    Undefined;
<img src="../../Functions/image129.png">=Big positive number<img src="../../Functions/image130.png"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image131.png">=Big positive number <img src="../../Functions/image132.png"><br>
<img src="../../Functions/image133.png">
<p>You actually do not need a calculator to do these. We know that when a negative number 
has an even exponent, the negative goes away; so if you are dealing with a limit where zero 
is in the denominator when you plug it in, you are either going to get positive or 
negative infinity. The sign is what matters.</p></span></a>

<p>Sometimes you can use your knowledge of the graphs of basic functions to answer 
limit questions. Example:
<img src="../../Functions/image134.png">
<p>The graph of <img src="../../Functions/image135.png"> looks like <a href="#">this<img src="../../Graphs/graph1over(x-3).png" class="imgA1"></a></p>
As you can see, from the left side of x=3, <img src="../../Functions/image136.png"> approaches 
<img src="../../Functions/image137.png"> while from the right side of 3 it approaches 
<img src="../../Functions/image138.png">. So, <img src="../../Functions/image134.png"> does not exist.</p>
