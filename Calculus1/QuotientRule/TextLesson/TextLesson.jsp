<h3>3.6 - Quotient Rule</h3>
<span> <!-- The unique lesson content goes here -->

<p>Here is the formula for the quotient rule:</p>
<img src="../../Functions/image261.png">
<p>So the order of the terms in the numerator matters, unlike with the product rule where it didn't matter.</p>
<p>An easy way to memorize this is to say, "low D high minus high D low over low low."</p>
<p>So let's take the derivative of a quotient:</p>

<p>Notice that we could have done algebra before we did calculus:</p>

	<span class="B1">You do not <i>really</i> need to memorize the quotient rule; it is just in your best 
interest to. The quotient rule does the step of factoring out a negative exponent for you that you would have 
to do every time with the product rule when you take the derivative of a quotient. This is built into the 
formula of the quotient rule.
