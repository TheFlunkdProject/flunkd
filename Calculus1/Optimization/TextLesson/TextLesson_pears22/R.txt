<span id="box5Trigger">Substitute it back in:</span>$$A=y(5-y)$$  (before we take the derivative, it's good to do algebra if we can.)<span id="box5">Still Step 2. Make sure it is in one variable</span>$$A=5y-y^2$$<span id="box6Trigger">$$\frac{dA}{dy}=5-2y=0$$$$y=5/2$$</span><span id="box6">Step 3. Take the derivative, set it equal to zero, and find the critical numbers</span><span id="box7Trigger">$$A''=-2$$</span>The second derivative is negative, so every critical number (the one that we have...) is a maximum. So we maximize the area when $y=5/2$.<span id="box7">Step 4. Make sure it is a maximum or a minimum with either the first derivative test or the second derivative test</span>

<BR><span id="box8Trigger">There are a couple of questions that they could be asking about this problem:</span> What is the maximum area we can enclose with 10 feet of fencing? $$A=y(y-5)=\frac{5}{2}(5-\frac{5}{2})=\frac{5}{2}(\frac{5}{2})=\frac{25}{4}\,ft^2$$ What are the dimensions of the rectangle that can enclose the most area? $$x=5-y=5-\frac{5}{2}=\frac{5}{2}=2.5ft$$ $$\Rightarrow 2.5\, ft \times 2.5\,ft$$(a square).<span id="box8">Step 5. Answer the specific question they ask.</span>

<BR>The best way to learn how to do optimization is to look at a lot of examples and practice a lot.
