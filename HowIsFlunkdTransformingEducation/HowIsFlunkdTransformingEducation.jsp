<h1 id="MainQuestion">How is flunk'd transforming education?</h1>
<p>Flunk'd is testing an idea that has never been implemented in 
education until now. It uses a program to systematize the enourmous 
emount of online student resources so that it can present students 
information that matches their personal learning style. 
We are the first people to try this!</p>
<p>We will give students access to the best digital tools currently available, 
helping them take full advantage of the power that current technology has to offer. 
These tools include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Practice problems</li>
<li>Games</li>
<li>A note taking program</li>
<li>Built-in highlighting capabilities</li>
<li>The Anki flash card program</li>
<li>Wolfram Alpha, for quick solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Technology is the future. Our aim is to inspire a new vision 
of the possibilities that already are within our means to realize. We look forward to providing a 
unique and invaluable service to students everywhere with our adaptive learning system.</p>
<p>Please contact us if you have any suggestions.</p>
